# PSY 203 Labs

The primary website for this course is <https://faculty.bard.edu/~jdainerbest/psy-203>

This github repository contains R lab code for labs in Bard College's Fall 2020 for Statistics for Psychology, taught by Prof. Justin Dainer-Best. 

# Labs

Over the following labs, you will learn to use R and RStudio to create documents, import and analyze data, munge and visualize data, and run basic statistical tests.

Labs will be uploaded weekly during the Fall of 2020.

* [Instructions](00-install-packaged.md) for installing packages to set up for tutorials (these are included in Lab 1)
* [Lab 1](01-lab-instructions.md): Learn the basics of R like variables and data frames, how to comment, and the basics of subsetting using the `$` and `dplyr`
* [Lab 2](02-lab-instructions.md): Practice subsetting, learn to knit R Markdown documents, and learn about filtering data
* [Lab 3](03-lab-instructions.md): Learn to visualize data, practice importing data, and begin exploring graphs
* [Lab 4](04-lab-instructions.md): Continue practicing basic visualization while exploring the procedures of testing hypotheses in R
* [Lab 5](05-lab-instructions.md): Build on your skills with `ggplot2` and run a *z*-test with a sample mean and a one-sample *t*-test, learning the difference between each
* [Lab 6](06-lab-instructions.md): Practice identifying mistakes and errors, learn to work with missing data, and learn how to add error bars in `ggplot2`
* [Lab 7](07-lab-instructions.md): Work out the differences between **dependent** and **independent** samples *t*-tests, and how to calculate both with the `t.test()` function; learn to use `pivot_longer()` from the {tidyr} package to restructure data
* [Lab 8](08-lab-instructions.md): Practice using the skills from the first seven labs. Test yourself: can you analyze real data? 
* [Lab 9](09-lab-instructions.md): Learn to run a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in R, to conduct pairwise-*t*-tests, and to plot the results
